<h3><a href = "Dataset"> Dataset </a> </h3>

This section contains images of different types of ships, including cargo, cruise, military, tankers, and carriers. These images are an integral part of our project and are used for various purposes, such as classification, analysis, or visual assets. They are organized by ship type, making it easy to access and utilize them for development, testing, or any other project-related activities.

<h3><a href = "Ship%20Classification.ipynb"> Ship Classification Jupyter Notebook </a> </h3>

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and detailed instructions for developing deep learning models for ship classification. It focuses on classifying different types of ships, including cargo, cruise, military, tankers, and carriers, based on image data. The notebook includes code snippets, explanations, and visualization tools to guide users through the process of building and training deep learning models for ship classification.

<h3><a href = "Flask"> Flask Source Code </a> </h3>

In this section, you'll find the Flask-specific code and configurations used in the "Ship Classification Project." It includes route definitions, view functions, HTML templates, and Flask-specific configurations along with the App. This information is essential for understanding how the Flask framework is utilized to power the project's web application.

<h3><a href = "Project%20Manual.pdf"> Project Manual </a> </h3>

The Project Manual is a foundational document for the Ship Classification Project, providing clear objectives, methodologies, and best practices. It defines roles and responsibilities, ensuring systematic execution and fostering a shared vision for a successful ship classification system. <br>It contains the following sections:

- Preparing the Data: Provides guidance on downloading the dataset and categorizing images, essential for data preparation.

- Data Pre-processing: Explains how to import and configure the ImageDataGenerator library for effective data pre-processing, applied to both training and testing sets.

- Building the Model: Gives detailed instructions on creating, compiling, and training a pre-trained model for ship classification. It includes monitoring validation loss and testing with custom inputs.

- Building Flask Application: Elaborates on building a Flask web application and creating an HTML page for execution, vital for deploying the ship classification model.
