The Project Manual is a foundational document for the Ship Classification Project, providing clear objectives, methodologies, and best practices. It defines roles and responsibilities, ensuring systematic execution and fostering a shared vision for a successful ship classification system. <br>It contains the following sections:

Preparing the Data
- Provides guidance on downloading the dataset and categorizing images, essential for data preparation.

Data Pre-processing
- Explains how to import and configure the ImageDataGenerator library for effective data pre-processing, applied to both training and testing sets.

Building the Model
- Gives detailed instructions on creating, compiling, and training a pre-trained model for ship classification. It includes monitoring validation loss and testing with custom inputs.

Building Flask Application
- Elaborates on building a Flask web application and creating an HTML page for execution, vital for deploying the ship classification model.
