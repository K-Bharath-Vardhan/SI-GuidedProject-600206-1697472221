## Overview

The Ship Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of ships based on their visual features. This project is a part of our commitment to advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals

- Train a machine learning model on a dataset of ship images.
- Achieve high accuracy in ship classification.
- Deploy the model for real-world ship classification applications.

## Project Phases

<h3><a href="1.%20Ideation%20Phase">1. Ideation Phase</a></h3>

In this initial phase, we will focus on brainstorming and gathering insights about the project. We'll employ two valuable tools:

#### Empathy Map Canvas

The Empathy Map Canvas will help us deeply understand the perspectives and needs of our target users, enabling us to create a user-centric ship classification solution.

#### Brainstorming Map

The Brainstorming Map will serve as a hub for creative thinking, allowing us to explore a wide range of ideas and strategies for the Ship Classification Project.

<h3><a href="2.%20Design%20Phase">2. Design Phase</a></h3>
In the Design Phase, we will create a blueprint for our ship classification solution. This phase will include the following key elements:

#### Proposed Solution
We'll define the overall solution for ship classification. This involves defining the problem statement, idea, novelty, social impact, business model, scalability.

#### Solution Architecture
We will design the technical architecture of our ship classification system. This will include deciding on the infrastructure, such as cloud services or on-premises servers, and how the various components of the system will interact along with a software diagram.

#### Data Flow Diagram
A data flow diagram will illustrate how data will be collected, processed, and fed into the machine learning model. It will show the data sources, data processing steps, and model training and evaluation processes.

<h3><a href="3.%20Planning%20Phase">3. Planning Phase</a></h3>
In the Planning Phase, we will create a plan for our ship classification model. This phase will include the following key elements:

#### Technology Stack
In this phase, we define the technology stack for the ship classification project, covering technical architecture, components & technologies, and application characteristics.

#### Project Planning Details
This section focuses on the planning aspects of the project, including the product backlog, sprint schedule, project tracker, velocity & burndown chart, board section, backlog section, and project timeline.

<h3><a href="4.%20Development%20Phase">4. Development Phase</a></h3>
In the Development Phase, we will actively implement the ship classification model, building on the plan created during the Planning Phase. This phase encompasses the following key elements:


#### Dataset
This section features images of various ship types, such as cargo, cruise, military, tankers, and carriers. These images are integral to our project, serving for classification, analysis, and visual purposes. They are organized by ship type for easy access and use in development, testing, and related project tasks.

#### Ship Classification Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook contains code and instructions for deep learning ship classification. It covers cargo, cruise, military, tankers, and carriers using image data. The notebook includes code, explanations, and visual tools to guide users in building and training ship classification models.

#### Flask Source Code
Here, you'll find the Flask source code for the "Ship Classification Project." It includes route definitions, view functions, HTML templates, and Flask configurations. This code is essential for understanding how Flask powers the project's web application.

#### Project Manual
A project manual is a comprehensive guide that outlines project objectives, methodologies, roles, and best practices. It serves as a navigation tool and collaborative resource, ensuring systematic and successful project execution.

<h3><a href="5.%20Performance%20and%20Final%20Submission%20Phase">5. Performance and Final Submission Phase</a></h3>
In the Performance and Final Submission Phases, we assess and refine the ship classification model developed in the previous phase. Our goal is to validate its performance and create a detailed report for the final submission.

#### Solution Performance 
The Solution Performance is a document that includes a summary of the model and its accuracy, encompassing both training and validation results.

#### Project Documentation
This comprehensive set of records includes details regarding data collection, deep learning model development, evaluation metrics, code, user interfaces, and deployment procedures. It serves as a vital reference for project stakeholders, offering support for troubleshooting, future maintenance, and the transfer of knowledge.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Your commitment has brought us here, and success is on the horizon. Best of luck as we move forward!
