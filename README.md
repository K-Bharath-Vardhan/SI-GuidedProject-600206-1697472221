# Ship Classification Project

## Overview

The Ship Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of ships based on their visual features. This project is a part of our commitment to advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals

- Train a machine learning model on a dataset of ship images.
- Achieve high accuracy in ship classification.
- Deploy the model for real-world ship classification applications.

## Project Phases

<h3><a href="1.%20Ideation%20Phase">1. Ideation Phase</a></h3>

In this initial phase, we will focus on brainstorming and gathering insights about the project. We'll employ two valuable tools:

#### Empathy Map Canvas

The Empathy Map Canvas will help us deeply understand the perspectives and needs of our target users, enabling us to create a user-centric ship classification solution.

#### Brainstorming Map

The Brainstorming Map will serve as a hub for creative thinking, allowing us to explore a wide range of ideas and strategies for the Ship Classification Project.

<h3><a href="2.%20Design%20Phase">2. Design Phase</a></h3>
In the Design Phase, we will create a blueprint for our ship classification solution. This phase will include the following key elements:

#### Proposed Solution
We'll define the overall solution for ship classification. This involves defining the problem statement, idea, novelty, social impact, business model, scalability.

#### Solution Architecture
We will design the technical architecture of our ship classification system. This will include deciding on the infrastructure, such as cloud services or on-premises servers, and how the various components of the system will interact along with a software diagram.

#### Data Flow Diagram
A data flow diagram will illustrate how data will be collected, processed, and fed into the machine learning model. It will show the data sources, data processing steps, and model training and evaluation processes.

<h3><a href="3.%20Planning%20Phase">3. Planning Phase</a></h3>
In the Planning Phase, we will create a plan for our ship classification model. This phase will include the following key elements:

#### Technology Stack
In this phase, we define the technology stack for the ship classification project, covering technical architecture, components & technologies, and application characteristics.

#### Project Planning Details
This section focuses on the planning aspects of the project, including the product backlog, sprint schedule, project tracker, velocity & burndown chart, board section, backlog section, and project timeline.
