# Ship Classification Project

## Overview

The Ship Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of ships based on their visual features. This project is a part of our commitment to advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Project Goals

- Train a machine learning model on a dataset of ship images.
- Achieve high accuracy in ship classification.
- Deploy the model for real-world ship classification applications.

## Project Phases

##[1. Ideation Phase]

In this initial phase, we will focus on brainstorming and gathering insights about the project. We'll employ two valuable tools:

#### Empathy Map Canvas

The Empathy Map Canvas will help us deeply understand the perspectives and needs of our target users, enabling us to create a user-centric ship classification solution.

#### Brainstorming Map

The Brainstorming Map will serve as a hub for creative thinking, allowing us to explore a wide range of ideas and strategies for the Ship Classification Project.
