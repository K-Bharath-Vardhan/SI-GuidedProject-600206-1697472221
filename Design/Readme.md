# Project Design Phase

Welcome to the Design Phase of our Ship Classification Project. In this section, you'll find crucial information about our proposed solution, solution architecture, and a data flow diagram.

##1. [Proposed Solution](Proposed%20Solution.pdf)

In this section, we outline the proposed solution, including its objectives and expected outcomes. This solution is designed to address specific challenges and meet the project's goals.

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

Our solution architecture is designed to ensure efficiency, scalability, and reliability. Here's an overview of the key components:

#### Component 1: [Component Name]
- **Description**: Explain the purpose and functionality of this component.
- **Technology Stack**: List the technologies, frameworks, or languages used.
- **Dependencies**: Mention any external services, libraries, or tools required.

#### Component 2: [Component Name]
- **Description**: Explain the purpose and functionality of this component.
- **Technology Stack**: List the technologies, frameworks, or languages used.
- **Dependencies**: Mention any external services, libraries, or tools required.

## Data Flow Diagram

We've created a data flow diagram to illustrate how information moves through the system. This diagram represents the flow of data within the project.
